# DBToaster experimental implementation

This folder holds some experimental, preliminary query implementations
for the [DBToaster] SQL interface


## Preparation

 1. place CSV files generated by the datagen in the `data/raw` directory
 2. prepare CSV files for DBToaster by running `prepare-data.sh` from the LDBC SNB DBToaster implementation directory

## Running BI queries

The `run-bi-query.sh` is provided for convenience to run a single BI query through DBToaster after loading the schema and data.

This by default assumes that DBToaster binary if located at `$HOME/bin/dbtoaster/bin/dbtoaster`.
To override DBToaster path, set the `DBTOASTER_BIN` environment variable pointing to the DBToaster binary.

Example:

```shell
user@machine:~/git/ldbc_snb_implementations/dbtoaster$ ./run-bi-query.sh 1
```
